# AI-Car-Sim

As I grew up, I always enjoyed cars. I played tons of arcade/simulation racing games, collected toy replicas, and even pro-actively learned about the history of vehicles. Professional racing (especially formula) and vehicle engineering are just things I have a ton of respect for. 

I really wanted to create something using software that would help demonstrate my passion for vehicles, but I felt a full-stack app or website was unoriginal and overdone. What truly inspired me to create this project was being a fanatic in perfecting the racing line and exploring the engineering/physics behind professional racing. 

And the most efficient way I learned was through an AI doing it. That is, creating a simulation where an AI tried to beat a racing course. 

### Features

- Simple to run. Just run the newcar.py file in an IDE like PyCharm. It loads a new screen generated by the pycharm library. 
- Personally its very interesting... not really a feature but fun to watch an AI learn to perfect a course

### Skills

- Programming languages: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: Pygame
- Other: Neural Networks, NEAT
